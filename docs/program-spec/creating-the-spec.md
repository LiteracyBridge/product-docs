# Creating Program Specification

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are new to the program specification, refer to the [Introductory Guide.](./introduction.md)

The program specification can be created in two ways, on the [Amplio Suite](#dashboard)  dashboard (recommended) and importing from an Excel Sheet.

## Amplio Suite Dashboard {#dashboard}

To create program specification, login to the [dashboard](https://suite.amplio.org)
and click on the ["Program Specification"](https://suite.amplio.org/programs/spec) item from the sidebar.

On the dashboard, there are three (3) tabs representing the five (5) sections of the program specification -  indicated by "1", as shown in the image below.

![Program Specification Overview](/images/suite/spec-overview.jpg)

1. The "General" tab for [General](./introduction.md#general) and [Languages](./introduction.md#languages)
2. "Deployment & Content" tab for [Deployments](./introduction.md#deployments) and  [Contents](./introduction.md#contents)
3. Recipients tab for [Recipients](./introduction.md#recipients)

> [!NOTE]
> [Languages](./introduction.md#languages) is a dropdown field in the General forms. However, it must be on a separate sheet when [importing from excel file](#excel).

## Saving

After updating the specification or importing it from an Excel file, click **"Save"** to store your changes.

## Publishing

To make the updated specification accessible in the [Audio Content Manager (ACM)](../acm/introduction.md), click **"Publish"**.

## Discard

Click the **Discard** button to remove any changes made to the specification.

> [!WARNING]
> Clicking the **Discard** button will permanently delete all unsaved changes to the specification.
