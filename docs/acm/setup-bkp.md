# Importing Contents

Here’s a quick note about importing content:

According to the [Program Specification](../program-spec/introduction.md#contents), a single message can be available in multiple languages. This means that in the ACM, you need to upload a separate file for each language.

For example, if a message is specified in both English and French, it must be recorded in both languages. As a result, you will need to import two separate files — one for English and one for French — into the ACM.

To import contents:

1. [Open the ACM](installation.md#open-acm)
2. Click the menu icon in the top-right corner (the laptop image) of the ACM.
3. A window will appear, select the **Deployment** and **Language**
4. Click the **"Next"** button to go to the next stage
5. Click the **"Choose Audio File(s)** button and select the audio files to import
6. Click the **"Next"** button to go to the next stage
7. Match each audio file (in the **Audio Files** column) to the corresponding message (Title column)
8. Click the **"Next"** button to go to the next stage
9. Review selections. If you're not satisfied, click **"Prev"** to redo the selections
10. Click the **"Finish"** button to import contents
