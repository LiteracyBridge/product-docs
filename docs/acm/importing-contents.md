# Importing Contents

Here’s a quick note about importing content:

According to the [Program Specification](../program-spec/introduction.md#contents), a single message can be available in multiple languages. This means that in the ACM, you need to upload a separate file for each language.

For example, if a message is specified in both English and French, it must be recorded in both languages. As a result, you will need to import two separate files — one for English and one for French — into the ACM.

To import content into the ACM, follow these steps:

1. [Open the ACM](installation.md#open-acm)
2. Click the menu icon (a laptop image) in the top-left corner of the ACM.
3. Click the **Import Content** menu item
4. In the window that appears, select the **Deployment** and **Language** options.
5. Click **Next** to proceed.
6. Click **Choose Audio File(s)** and select the audio files you want to import.
7. Click **Next** to continue.
8. Match each audio file (in the **Audio Files** column) with its corresponding message (in the **Title** column).
9. Click **Next** to proceed.
10. Review your selections. If needed, click **Prev** to make changes.
11. Click **Finish** to complete the import process.

> [!TIP]
> Once imported, the content will appear in the ACM interface, as shown below:
